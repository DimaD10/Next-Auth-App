# Next Auth App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About 

A simple web application using **Next.JS** to demonstrate my ability to work with **authorization** and **registration** and working with tools that offer libraries. 
The application is fully adaptive for any screen resolution and for any client. 

#### **Provided logic:**

1. Unauthorized users are not allowed to access the home page and order page. 
2. Authorization is possible using Google or Microsoft account, as well as using user credentials (automatically when loading the page) and username with password.
3. Registration is possible using the same Google and Microsoft accounts, or using your username and creating a strong password.
4. In case of successful authorization or registration, the user is automatically redirected to the main page and also allows you to log out of your account.
5. In case of unsuccessful authorization or registration, the user is automatically redirected back to the login or registration page.


## Tools:

1. **Next.JS 14** To build the application.
2. **TypeScript** for typify.
3. **SCSS preprocessor** for convenient application styling.
4. **Module CSS approach** for unique styles for each component and convenience in the context of class names.
5. **Lucide Icons library** for quick access to user icons.
6. **Clerk** for quick building and using auth forms.
7. Nex.JS image and font **optimization features**.
